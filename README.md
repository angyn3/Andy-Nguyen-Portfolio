# <Andy Nguyen's Portfolio>

## Description

Upon figuring out how to create my own personal web page portfolio, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts of how to put together an HTML file mixed with CSS. Through further reasearch on google and youtube I was able to slightly understand what I wasn't able to in class. Although my portfolio is not different from what is shown via example on the module, I was able to put together a web page through tutorials and step-by-step guides.
